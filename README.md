# Pyramid-TTS
A major concern in text to speech (TTS) synthesis is that the synthesized speech cannot well express the speaker's voice characteristics. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel TTS model towards high-quality speech synthesis based on a speech feature pyramid. The feature pyramid consists of low-level and high-level features that can represent the voice characteristics in accordance with basic sound elements. Specifically, low-level features refer to voice characteristics of energy and pitch, which are extracted from the audio spectrogram and correspond to the sound elements of loundness and tone. The high-level features are obtained by time-frequency analysis of mel spectrogram that inherit the sound element of timbre. Then, the low-level and high-level features are fused in the  pyramid form to obtain the comprehensive voice characterization of the speaker. Finally, the synthesized high-quality speech is obtained through the neural network. The extensive experiments on public speech datasets like LJSpeech and libriTTS, demonstrate the proposed method can effectively synthesize high-quality speech that is closer to the speaker's voice characteristics than state-of-the-art methods.
